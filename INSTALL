This is a bare-bones explanation of how to install Demeter from
source.

Install Ifeffit
===============

Download Ifeffit from http://cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit/Downloads
Unpack the tarball, cd into the new directory, then

  a. Install PGPLOT:

       sudo ./PGPLOT_install

  b. Install Ifeffit:

       ./configure
       make
       sudo make install

Install Demeter
===============

Download Demeter from github:

   git clone git://github.com/bruceravel/demeter.git

cd into the demeter directory and do

   perl Build.PL
   sudo ./Build installdeps

This step is quite time consuming the first time you install Demeter.
Several dozen Perl dependencies will be downloaded, built, and
installed.  Answer "yes" to every question you are asked.

Once finished, do

   perl Build.PL

again to verify that all the dependencies are in place.  Then do

   ./Build
   sudo ./Build install

It is tailored to an Ubuntu system, but should provide insight to anyone
installing from source.
